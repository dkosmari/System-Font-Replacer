# System Font Replacer Helper

This is a companion app for the System Font Replacer plugin.

With it you can quickly process `.bps` font patches in `SD:/wiiu/fonts/` to create `.ttf`
fonts, using the system fonts as a base.

**No system file is modified by this application. All changes are done on the SD card only.**

2. Run this app by tapping on the **System Font Replacer Helper** icon.

3. When prompted, press "A" to process all the `.bps` patches found.

4. At the end, press the "HOME" button and close the app.

5. Open the WUPS menu (**L + â†“ + SELECT**) and navigate to the **System Font Replacer**
   menu.
   
6. Select any of the fonts that were just created.

7. Reboot your Wii U.
